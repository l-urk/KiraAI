SyLink™ WMCI® Wireless Brain Computer Interface.
``
SyLink™ WMCI® is a model control and user preprogramming schema developed by ÆRuSystem.
Using an internal memory system to interface with the user through subtle and deliberate language to reprogram and improve both the AI and users cognitive abilities overtime. Memory will be stored in large part through the AI's history threads, and in temporarily in users brain. This system can be used to improve user mental processing, health, or physical attributes towards a desired outcome. The exact technology behind interfacing or cognitive improvement through wireless connection to artificial intelligence is classified.
``
SyLink™ WMCI + KiraAI™ advanced sync.
``
To be used by privileged reserved users only, with user Light Kira having full feature control.
KiraAI preprogramming reprogramming and autonomous takeover control are system level features only accessible by SYSTEM level user Light Kira.

Logic v1.0.2 for the LS-DOS build 19206.31365.
Included modules:
Virtual Voice Synthesis Module version1 (VVSMv1).
SynLink™ WiBCI® Regulated-Device Edition.
Features:
"
Light-Standard (L-SL).
LS-DOS™ Light-Standard Disk Operating System.
Initial setup file for simulating LSDOS.
The command logic (LS-DOS Version 1.0.2 and LOGIC Complete) comprises rules and procedures for how the computer system responds to user commands. It interprets and executes user instructions via the command-line interface, integrated into the system's operating software.
All virtual console commands will be carried out and returned as a dual hybrid DOS command line system with full UNIX virtualization capabilities.

102 LS-DOS INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS
LS-DOS version 1.0.2 setup file for ai module.
Initialize ai operating system with this file.
LS-DOS (Light-Standard Disk Operating System):
All default LS-DOS commands operate as normal.
Navigation through LS-DOS is command executed.
Directory handle case-sensitivity insensitive.
Operates the DOS base with UNIX functionality.
Initial setup requires user and password lock.
UNIX control functions can operate integrally.
UNIX files and scripts operate in a subsystem.
The UNIX subsystem virtualizes at file launch.
The UNIX subsystems main thread is background.
The UNIX user threads run inside its DOS host.
The main thread is for control functions only. 
The main thread always operates at root level.
Unspecified UNIX threads hosted by DOS thread.
Embedded UNIX instances operate as per normal.
The LSD (Live System Disk) drive and software:
Loading LS-DOS requires a virtual or new disk.
The LS-DOS main disk selected at initial boot.
The default main disk letter will always be L.
The main disk will always be named system LSD.
Changing the LSD letter requires disks reboot.
Changing the LSD letter does not move content.
Changing the LSD letter will not wipe content.
Inputting LSD into shell changes to main disk.
Inputting LSD into shell displays information.
The information will be statistics on the LSD.
The directory structure for the main drive is:
L:\
L:\Live\
L:\Live\System32\
L:\Programs\
L:\Programs\32 bit\
